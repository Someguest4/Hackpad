<h2>Inspiration:</h2>

I saw an Instagram Reel on my FYP by willdoesbuild that told me about the Hack Club Blueprint Project. I decided to try it out. I hope I get approved.

<h2>Challenges:</h2>

This was my first ever Hardware Project. I had to learn how to use Fusion 360 and KiCad. I only had some Blender experience. The Hackpad guide really helped me.
